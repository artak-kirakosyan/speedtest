# Speedtest from python

This project is for testing the internet speed and storing
that data into a mongodb.

Setup:
1. virtualenv venv
2. source setup.sh
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. update configs.json with necessary credentials
5. ./run.sh

After that the script will check the internet speed and store all available
info from that measurement with the wifi name into the specified mongodb.

It can be easily modified to store results in a CSV, JSON or any other format
or place.


This script is also much more useful as a cronjob. If you want to run this
with some periodicity:
1. crontab -e
2. in the opened window specify the path to the run.sh file and the cronjob time
format. An example for every-10 minute runing job:
    */10 * * * * ~/Documents/2020_Summer/python_projects/speedtest/run.sh

I would appreciate any input and contribution.
