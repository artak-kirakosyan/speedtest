# Speedtest from python

This project is for testing the internet speed and storing
that data into a mongodb.

Setup:
1. virtualenv venv
2. source setup.sh
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. update configs.json with necessary credentials
        queue_file: a filename where the results will be stored temporarily 
                     in JSON format if failed to insert into mongodb
        log_file: logging file name
        connection_string: connection string of the mongodb
        db_name: default DB of the mongodb to be used
        collection_name: default collection where to insert infomation
        datetime_format: apart from info received from speedtest, I add a "measured"
                         field into documents. This format will be used to format
                         and store that field
5. update the config_path in measure.py file
6. ./run.sh

After that the script will check the internet speed and store all available
info from that measurement with the wifi name into the specified mongodb.

It can be easily modified to store results in a CSV, JSON or any other format
or place.


This script is also much more useful as a cronjob. If you want to run this
with some periodicity:
1. crontab -e
2. in the opened window specify the path to the run.sh file and the cronjob time
format. An example for every-10 minute runing job:
    */10 * * * * ~/Documents/2020_Summer/python_projects/speedtest/run.sh

I would appreciate any input and contribution.
